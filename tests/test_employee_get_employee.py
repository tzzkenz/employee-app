# `pytest_asyncio` provides the *async-aware* fixture decorator. Plain
# `@pytest.fixture` doesn't know how to drive an `async def` body — you
# have to use `@pytest_asyncio.fixture` whenever the fixture itself is
# async or yields an async resource.

# The fixture: a single function that owns the engine, the schema, and
# the session — and tears it all back down when the test finishes.


# The test is now pure "act + assert" — no engine, no create_all, no
# cleanup. Pytest sees the `db_session` parameter, runs the fixture
# above, and hands the yielded session in.
